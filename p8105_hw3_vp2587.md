## Problem 1

The goal is to do some exploration of this dataset. To that end, write a
short description of the dataset, noting the size and structure of the
data, describing some key variables, and giving illustrative examples of
observations. Then, do or answer the following (commenting on the
results of each):

1.  How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items
    ordered from?

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle, name = "n_obs") %>%
  arrange(desc(n_obs)) %>% 
  head()
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 × 2
    ##   aisle                          n_obs
    ##   <chr>                          <int>
    ## 1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ## 2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ## 3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ## 4 yogurt                         55240
    ## 5 packaged cheese                41699
    ## 6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617

There are 134 different aisles. The `fresh vegetables` and
`fresh fruits` are by far the most popular aisles, followed by
`packaged vegetables fruits`, `yogurt`, and `packaged cheese`.

2.  Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
    limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
    aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
instacart %>%
  count(aisle, name = "n_obs") %>%
  filter(n_obs > 10000) %>%
  mutate(aisle = forcats::fct_reorder(aisle, n_obs)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n_obs, color = aisle)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Aisles With Over 10000 Items Ordered",
    x = "Aisle Names",
    y = "Number of of Items Ordered"
  ) +
  viridis::scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

3.  Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the
    aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged
    vegetables fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered
    in your table.

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
  group_by(aisle, product_name) %>% 
  summarize(order_count = n()) %>%
  arrange(aisle, desc(order_count)) %>%
  slice_max(order_count, n = 3)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'aisle'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

    ## # A tibble: 9 × 3
    ## # Groups:   aisle [3]
    ##   aisle                      product_name                            order_count
    ##   <chr>                      <chr>                                         <int>
    ## 1 baking ingredients         Light Brown Sugar                               499
    ## 2 baking ingredients         Pure Baking Soda                                387
    ## 3 baking ingredients         Cane Sugar                                      336
    ## 4 dog food care              Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog…          30
    ## 5 dog food care              Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe              28
    ## 6 dog food care              Small Dog Biscuits                               26
    ## 7 packaged vegetables fruits Organic Baby Spinach                           9784
    ## 8 packaged vegetables fruits Organic Raspberries                            5546
    ## 9 packaged vegetables fruits Organic Blueberries                            4966

4.  Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
    Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week;
    format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow,
    values_from = mean_hour,
    names_prefix = "Day_"
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

    ## # A tibble: 2 × 8
    ## # Groups:   product_name [2]
    ##   product_name     Day_0 Day_1 Day_2 Day_3 Day_4 Day_5 Day_6
    ##   <chr>            <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 Coffee Ice Cream  13.8  14.3  15.4  15.3  15.2  12.3  13.8
    ## 2 Pink Lady Apples  13.4  11.4  11.7  14.2  11.6  12.8  11.9

## Problem 2

This Problem uses the Zillow datasets introduced in Homework 2. Both
datasets are available here. Import, clean, and otherwise tidy these
datasets.

``` r
zip_codes_df =
  read_csv("zillow_data/Zip Codes.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    zip_code = as.character(zip_code),
    borough  = recode(
      county,
      "New York" = "Manhattan",
      "Kings"    = "Brooklyn",
      "Queens"   = "Queens",
      "Bronx"    = "Bronx",
      "Richmond" = "Staten Island",
    )
  ) %>%
  select(zip_code, borough)
```

    names_to = "ym_str",
    values_to = "rent"
  ) %>%
  rename(zip_code = region_name) %>% 
  mutate(
    ym_str = stringr::str_remove(ym_str, "^x"),
    ym_str = stringr::str_replace_all(ym_str, "_", "-"),
    date   = lubridate::ymd(ym_str),
    year   = lubridate::year(date),
    month  = lubridate::month(date),
    day    = lubridate::day(date),
    zip_code = as.character(zip_code))

```

    ## Warning in left_join(., zip_codes_df, by = "zip_code"): Detected an unexpected many-to-many relationship between `x` and `y`.
    ## ℹ Row 4757 of `x` matches multiple rows in `y`.

There are 116 months between January 2015 and August 2024. How many ZIP
codes are observed 116 times? How many are observed fewer than 10 times?
Why are some ZIP codes are observed rarely and others observed in each
month?

Create a reader-friendly table showing the average rental price in each
borough and year (not month). Comment on trends in this table.

Make a plot showing NYC Rental Prices within ZIP codes for all available
years. Your plot should facilitate comparisons across boroughs. Comment
on any significant elements of this plot.

Compute the average rental price within each ZIP code over each month in
2023. Make a reader-friendly plot showing the distribution of
ZIP-code-level rental prices across boroughs; put differently, your plot
should facilitate the comparison of the distribution of average rental
prices across boroughs. Comment on this plot.

Combine the two previous plots into a single graphic, and export this to
a results folder in your repository.
